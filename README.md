# brio internship assignment

Design a web page that adheres to the following criteria. Remember, it doesn’t have
to be perfect, we just want to see your base knowledge of HTML and CSS.

Requirements
1. Fluid width
2. Header with a height of 100px
3. Login button at the right corner of the header (doesn’t have to be functional)
4. Left-side and Right-side panels with 100px width
5. Center panel for the content (can be 1 or more rows of article text)
6. Footer which always will be at the bottom. Even if article has 1 row
7. Divs only (No table layout)

Bonus
Add a textbox that lets the user enter any string and check if it is a palindrome. A
palindrome is a word that is the same forwards and backwards, like “pop” or “racecar”
or “tacocat”.
1. Add a textbox to your design
2. Add a submit button
3. Write a function that will be called when the submit button is clicked that
checks if the string is a palindrome (You can use Javascript or C#, or a
combination of the two)
4. Display the result (“Yes” or “No”) on the page after the user clicks submit

Double Bonus
1. Allow for a sentence to be entered as the string. Example: senile felines
2. Ignore upper and lower case letters in the string. Example: Noel sees Leon
3. Allow the sentence to have punctuation and ignore it when checking to see if it is a palindrome. Examples: "A man, a plan, a canal -- Panama", "Never a foot too far, even."
